# Secure_Chat-Application
This project focuses on secure communication — which is a core concept in cybersecurity. This project is a secure chat system that allows two users to communicate safely over a network. It uses socket programming in Python for real-time message transfer and public-key cryptography to protect messages.
Features
End-to-end encryption using RSA
- Secure key exchange
- Real-time chat via socket programming
- GUI built with PyQt5

Technologies Used
- Python 3
- PyQt5
- Socket Programming
- PyCryptodome (for encryption)

How to Run
1. Run `server.py` first
2. Then run `client.py` on two different terminals
3. Enter the same server IP and port in both clients
4. Start chatting securely!

 Cybersecurity Concept
This project demonstrates **public key cryptography** and **secure message transmission**,  
which are key parts of **Cybersecurity** and **Data Privacy**.
